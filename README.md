# React Native FlatList Empty Render Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native where a FlatList component renders empty despite successfully fetching data from an API. The problem stems from a discrepancy between the expected data structure and the actual API response.

## Problem

The `DataList` component fetches data from an API endpoint.  While the fetch request is successful, and the data is logged to the console, the FlatList remains empty. This is because the data processing within the component is not correctly handling the format of the API response.

## Solution

The solution involves inspecting the API response to understand its structure. The code then needs to be adjusted to correctly map the data to the format expected by the FlatList `renderItem` function.  This might involve changes to how the `data` variable is used or how individual items are accessed.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios` to start the app.
4. Observe that the FlatList remains blank despite successful API call.

## Note

This example uses a placeholder API.  Replace 'https://api.example.com/data' with your actual API endpoint.
